### About
  Welcome to my portfolio!

My name is Sujatha Ahilan. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from India and previously worked as a Test Analyst for a few years. Currently, I am working as a freelance Data Analyst and actively building my expertise in data-related roles.

I took a career break due to family commitments, and now I’m excited to transition into a full-time data role, leveraging both my analytical skills and technical background. I have hands-on experience with tools such as SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI, and a solid understanding of key data analytics techniques including:

Data cleaning and preparation

Data wrangling

Statistical analysis

Dashboard design

Data storytelling and reporting

In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of projects that highlight my technical capabilities and analytical thinking. These include SQL scripts, dashboards, Excel models, and PowerPoint presentations, all focused on transforming data into actionable insights. Each project is designed to demonstrate how I turn raw data into meaningful visualizations and business decisions.
